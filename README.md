## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click "Roll Dice" on your turn.
3. Move your token forward based on the dice number.
4. Landing on:
   - The **base of a ladder** → move up.
   - The **head of a snake** → slide down.
5. First player to reach **100** wins.

   ## 📋 Game Rules
- Players roll a die each turn and move forward accordingly.
- If a player lands exactly on:
  - A **ladder base** → they go up.
